## SOLID

### Single Responsibility Principle 
There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

### Open Closed Principle (OCP)
open for extension, but closed for modification 
- OCP + [Specification Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern)
